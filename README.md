This repository contains three beginner-friendly yet practical Python projects built using Object-Oriented Programming (OOPs) concepts. Each project simulates a small real-world system, helping to understand classes, objects, encapsulation, and method design in Python.

ðŸ“Œ Projects Included
1. Expense Tracker

Tracks expenses with categories and amounts.

Allows adding and listing expenses.

Useful for learning how objects can store and display structured data.

2. Library Management System

Manages books in a library.

Supports adding books, borrowing, and returning.

Demonstrates inventory management with classes and methods.

3. Student Grading System

Stores student records with marks.

Calculates average grades and assigns grade letters.

Shows how encapsulation and methods can handle calculations behind the scenes.

ðŸš€ How to Run
